Medium Priority:
- Configure the django site layout to more accurately match the idea we had for it
- Make it so that the html and css all are linked properly on the django site
- Figure out what to do with index.html (remove?)

Low Priority:
- Update admin.py
- Make unique titles for pages since base_generic.html seems to override
