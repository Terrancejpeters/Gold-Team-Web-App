# Gold-Team-Web-App
A Web App for Computer Science 326

THe Django files can be found in the gold_team folder

TODO:
High Priority:
- Add sessions
- Get icon in base_generic.html to show up
- Update other html files to work with base_generic.html
 - Make them like home.html or login.html where there is no head or body tags, just the block content
- Get Post object text, title, and maybe time to show on home and maybe User object elements to show on

Medium Priority:
- Configure the django site layout to more accurately match the idea we had for it
- Make it so that the html and css all are linked properly on the django site
- Figure out what to do with index.html (remove?)

Low Priority:
- Update admin.py
- Make unique titles for pages since base_generic.html seems to override
