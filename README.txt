TODO:
High Priority:
- Update admin.py
- Configure the django site layout to loosely match the idea we had for it
- Update base_generic.html
- Update other html files to work with base_generic.html
 - Make them like home.html where there is no head or body tags, just the block content

Medium Priority:
- Make it so that the html and css all are linked properly on the django site
- Figure out what to do with index.html (remove?)

Low Priority:
- Add sessions
- Make unique titles for pages since base_generic.html seems to override
