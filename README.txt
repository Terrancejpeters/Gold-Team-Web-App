THe Django files can be found in the gold_team folder

TODO:
High Priority:
- Add sessions
- Update other html files to work with base_generic.html
 - Make them like home.html or login.html where there is no head or body tags, just the block content
- Get Post object text, title, and maybe post_time to show on feed
 - Get user's posts to show on the bottom of their profile page
- Make password reset functional

Medium Priority:
- Configure the django site layout to more accurately match the idea we had for it
- Make it so that the html and css all are linked properly on the django site
- Get icon in base_generic.html to show up

Low Priority:
- Make unique titles for pages since base_generic.html seems to override
